|plugin_name|
=============

|plugin_name| enables you to publish your map metadata to a spatial catalogue (CSW)
like GeoNetwork opensource, or to publish the map itself as an OGC data service (WMS/WMTS/WFS/WCS)
to GeoServer or MapServer. |short_name| also offers the option to export metadata, symbology
and/or data as local files.

This QGIS plugin has been developed by `GeoCat <https://www.geocat.net>`_,
a Dutch-Canadian company focusing on the development, customization
and support of cutting-edge geospatial catalog software on both server and desktop platforms.
GeoCat provides all-in-one Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) solutions
that offer a geospatial catalog, map server and map client.
The software is based on established Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
projects, uses open standard protocols, and can be customized to the needs of
different clients.

The founder of GeoCat worked for many years with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
where he founded the `GeoNetwork opensource <https://geonetwork-opensource.org>`_ project.
Today, GeoNetwork opensource can be considered the leading open source geospatial catalog
application with numerous international and national geo-portal implementations.
