Introduction
=============

GeoCat BridgeÂ© for  QGIS enables you to publish your
metadata in a spatial catalogue (CSW), like GeoNetwork opensource, and
your map as OGC data services (WMS/WMTS/WFS/WCS) in GeoServer or
MapServer. Bridge also offers the option to export metadata, symbology
and/or data to your local computer as files.

This plugin has been developed by `GeoCat <http://geocat.net.>`_. GeoCat focuses on the development,
customization and support of cutting-edge geospatial software,
especially geospatial catalog software on both server and desktop.
GeoCat provides all-in-one solutions for the Spatial Data Infrastructure
(SDI) that offer a geospatial catalog, map server and map client. The
solutions are based on established Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
projects, open standard protocols and will be customized to the needs of
different clients.

The founder of GeoCat worked for many years with the United Nations
where he founded the `GeoNetwork
Opensource <http://geonetwork-opensource.org>`_ project. Today GeoNetwork
Opensource can be considered the leading open source geospatial catalog
application with numerous international and national geo-portal
implementations.
