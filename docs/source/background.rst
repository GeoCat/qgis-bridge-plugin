Background

When publishing data to the internet it is common practice to provide
the data using standardized exchange protocols. Adopting standards
facilitates a wide usage of the data. Within the geospatial domain, the OGC
and ISO TC211 data exchange standards are industry standards and
are often required by law, e.g. the European INSPIRE regulations.

The |app_name| extension takes care of exporting your map, data, styles and metadata to
opensource mapping platforms that provide data exchange and catalog
services that comply with these standards. |short_name| will properly link service and metadata
and vice versa, so users can easily bind to a service from a catalog search result or find the
relevant metadata for an exposed dataset.

Serverside software components currently supported by |short_name| are GeoServer, MapServer and GeoNetwork.
Some options are available to migrate data to and expose data from PostGIS.

You can also choose to save the metadata and map symbology on your computer as files
or in a GeoPackage so you can use them to publish on other software platforms
(e.g. deegree, QGIS).

Supported server types and formats
==================================

`GeoServer <http://geoserver.org/>`_ is the reference implementation of
the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)_ Web Feature Service (WFS) and Web
Coverage Service (WCS) standards, as well as a high performance
certified compliant Web Map Service (WMS). GeoServer has a REST API,
which can be used to configure feature types. |short_name| uses this API to publish data.
Geoserver internally uses `SLD <https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sld>`_
to define the visualisation of data layers.

`MapServer <https://mapserver.org>`_ is an Open Source platform for
publishing spatial data and interactive mapping applications to the web.
Originally developed in the mid-1990's at the University of Minnesota,
MapServer is released under an MIT-style license, and runs on all major
platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X).
Mapserver services are defined by `Mapfiles <https://www.mapserver.org/mapfile/>`_,
which can be generated by |short_name|.

`GeoNetwork <https://geonetwork-opensource.org>`_ is a catalog for registering
assets, such as spatial datasets. It contains a CatalogService for the Web (CSW) 
endpoint. GeoNetwork can operate on various metadata models via a plugin mechanism. It
supports ISO19115-3, ISO19139, ISO19110 and DCAT metadata standards. GeoNetwork
opensource software complies with the requirements of INSPIRE discovery services and metadata.

`GeoStyler <https://geostyler.org/>`_ is a JS library used in the `Shogun framework <https://github.com/terrestris/shogun-core>`_
to create generic styles. GeoServer also has a `plugin <https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/community/geostyler/index.html>`_
that allows to style layers using GeoStyler. |short_name| does not make use of the GeoStyler library, but it does use the GeoStyler format
internally as an intermediate format, which can be exported as a GeoStyler style file (JSON).

`Mapbox Style <https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/>`_ is a style format that defines the visual
appearance of vector tiles in the `Mapbox JavaScript API <https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/>`_.
|short_name| is able to generate a Mapbox style document.

`PostGIS <https://postgis.net/>`_ is a spatial extension to the popular open source Postgres database.
|short_name| is able to export any local data to a remote (or local) PostGIS database, allowing it
to be consumed by data services.
