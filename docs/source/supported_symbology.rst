Supported Symbology
###################

Bridge uses the `bridge-style` library to export QGIS aimbology into other formats such as SLD (used when uploading to GeoServer), MapServer files, or MapboxGL.

To know more about which elements of the QGIS symbology are supported when exporting to the different format available from the library, you can check its `documentation on this topic <https://github.com/GeoCat/bridge-style/blob/master/docs/qgis.md>`_
