Installation
############

Requirements
************

Client-side
-----------

|app_name| requires QGIS |min_qgis_ver| or newer.
Both the standalone QGIS installation or the OSGeo distribution should work.

QGIS users who use a QGIS version *beyond* 3.16 should verify that the ``lxml`` :ref:`Python dependency <lxml-dependency>` is available.
However, this only applies if you wish to import or publish metadata using |short_name|.

.. note::   If you access the internet through a proxy server,
            you might experience some issues while publishing data or connecting to a server.

Server-side
-----------

GeoNetwork
^^^^^^^^^^

|app_name| currently supports GeoNetwork version 3.4 and higher.
GeoNetwork 2.x support has been deprecated and version 4.x is not supported yet.

GeoServer
^^^^^^^^^

-   Support starts at GeoServer version 2.13 and up. However, other
    versions since 2.4 are expected to run fine in most of the
    cases.
-   If you wish to use a direct connection to PostGIS (i.e. let |short_name|
    handle the data upload instead of the GeoServer REST API), you will
    need to have access to that database instance.
-   If you wish to let GeoServer import your data into PostGIS (i.e. through
    the REST API instead of direct access), you need to make sure that the
    `Importer extension <https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/extensions/importer/index.html>`_
    is available on GeoServer.
    If you do not know if this extension is installed, simply try to publish
    something and |short_name| will warn you if it isn't.

MapServer
^^^^^^^^^

-   MapServer support starts at version 6.2 and up.
    However, other versions since 5.6 are expected to run fine in most of the cases.
-   FTP connection or file write access to MapServer project path.


How to install
**************

To install the |plugin_name|, please follow these steps:

1. Open the :guilabel:`QGIS Plugin Manager` by clicking on the :menuselection:`Plugins --> Manage and Install Plugins...` menu entry.

    .. image:: ./img/pluginmanagermenu.png

    You will now see a dialog similar to the one below, listing all your (pre-)installed plugins:

    .. image:: ./img/pluginmanager.png

2. Click the :guilabel:`All` section on the sidebar to list all available plugins. Scroll down to find "|gui_name|"
or use the search box at the top to filter the list (e.g. by typing "|short_name|"). Clicking on the "|gui_name|" plugin entry
will display detailed information about the plugin:

    .. image:: ./img/pluginmanagerbridge.png

4. Click :guilabel:`Install Plugin` and wait until |short_name| has been downloaded and installed.

5. Close the Plugin Manager when done. You should now have a new menu entry under the :menuselection:`Web` menu,
which contains a couple of menu items related the |short_name| plugin:

    .. image:: ./img/bridgemenuentry.png

6. You should also see a new toolbar button, that will open the |short_name| Publish dialog.

    .. image:: ./img/bridgetoolbarbutton.png


In the Plugin Manager settings, note that you can configure QGIS to automatically check for plugin updates.
Alternatively, you can update plugins manually using the :guilabel:`Upgrade All` button.
