|plugin_name|
=============

|plugin_name| enables you to publish your map metadata to a spatial catalogue (CSW)
like GeoNetwork, or to publish the map itself as an OGC data service (WMS/WMTS/WFS/WCS)
to GeoServer or MapServer. |short_name| also offers the option to export metadata, symbology
and/or data as local files.

This QGIS plugin has been developed by `GeoCat <https://www.geocat.net>`_,
a Dutch-Canadian company focusing on the development, customization
and support of cutting-edge geospatial catalog software on both server and desktop platforms.
GeoCat provides all-in-one Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) solutions
that offer a geospatial catalog, map server and map client.
The software is based on established Free and Open Source Software (FOSS4G)
projects, and uses open standard protocols.
